## **üéÆ About This Project**

This project was created to practice **data analysis** and **visualization** skills learned on the journey to mastering **machine learning**. Using Python and libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, we dived deep into global gaming behaviour to uncover trends and insights. 

To make this project more engaging, we aim to prove the hypothesis:

### **"High engagement correlates with increased in-game spending."**

Through detailed data analysis and visuals, we'll explore whether players who spend more time gaming also tend to spend more money on in-game purchases. This hypothesis is critical as it highlights the potential revenue opportunities for game developers targeting specific audiences.

## **üìä Hypothesis Validation**

Using data correlations, we investigated the relationship between **engagement levels** and **in-game purchases**:

- Players with "High Engagement" were found to contribute significantly more to in-game spending, validating our hypothesis.
- This correlation was most evident in the USA and Europe, emphasizing the potential profitability of targeting highly engaged audiences in these regions.

### **Implications for Game Developers:**
- **Focus on Engagement:** Strategies to boost playtime and sessions can directly enhance revenue through in-game purchases.
- **Regional Targeting:** Tailored content and marketing in the USA and Europe can maximize returns.

## **üåü Why It Matters**

- **Data Analysis in ML:** Data analysis is foundational to machine learning. Understanding trends and insights ensures better model performance and interpretability.
- **Visualization Skills:** Clear and impactful visuals make complex data understandable, an essential skill for ML practitioners.
- **Proving Hypotheses:** Validating hypotheses through real-world data bridges the gap between theory and practical application.
